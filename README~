Getting Barcodes to work on Rails was very difficult as very few of the resources I found worked and they were poorly documented.
Prawn and Barby turned out to be the only ones I could get to work.

First some basic information that you should know. When using Prawn, the Origin (0,0), is located at the bottom left.
When you rotate the pdf, (0,0) remains at the bottom left.

I am about to add add a few methods that helped me place my objects, it seems with Prawn the best way to position your objects is with alot of trial and error.



Here are a few of the addresses I viewed along the way, I do not expect many of them to prove useful for you.
I saved them incase I wanted to read them again.
